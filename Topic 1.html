                    <h2>Freedom 7</h2>                    
                    <p>On the 5th of May 1961 at 14:34 UTC a Redstone MRLV MR-7 rocket lifted off from a launch pad at Cape Canaveral LC-5. 
                        This was the first flight of the human part of the human flight program. abord was astronaut john glen who was the 
                        first American to fly above the Kármán line.</p>
                        <h4>The flight</h4>

                    <p>It is estimated 45 million people watched the launch live as john glen lifted off the launch pad, After lift-off, the
                         rocket accelerated slowly off the launch pad. As the rocket burned its flue it got lighter and the acceleration started 
                         to climb, at its max point, the spacecraft was pulling 6.3g. The max speed of the spacecraft was 8,340 km/h at a max 
                         altitude of 187.5 km, far above the Kármán line. After reaching apogee john glen took control of the spacecraft and flew
                          it through re-entry until the automatic system took over. The spacecraft pulled 11.6g during re-entry. The parachute was 
                          deployed at 6.4km slowing the spacecraft down until is spaced down in the ocean in good condition.  </p>
                          <h4>Mission objectives</h4>
                          <p>
                            The main mission objects were to test critical systems of the spacecraft.  The first objective was to test the RCS 
                            (reaction control system) while in space. This went well as the tasks were conducted successfully. The second task 
                            was to look out the periscope of the spacecraft and record what he saw, he noted continents, lakes and rivers however 
                            noting that it was hard to identify cities. However, the last task was to change the filter on the periscope, this task 
                            was unsuccessful as his hand didn’t fit as it got very close to the launch escape system lever.
