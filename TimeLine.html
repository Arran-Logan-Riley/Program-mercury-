                    to examine the affects micro gravity had on liquids. The second goal of the mission was to conduct photography from space. 
                    The last goal was to see if flares could be seen from space, which they could not. Scott Carpenter landed in Atlantic safely. </p>

                    a large amount of issues during the flight, but none of these issues were mission critical. The flight lasted six orbits with Wally

                    in orbit. Gordon cooper was in orbit for thirty-four hours covering 878,971 kilometres in twenty orbits. This mission was the last
                     of the mercury program and lead the way to the Gemini program. </p>
