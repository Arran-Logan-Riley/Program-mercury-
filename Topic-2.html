                        <h2>Liberty bell 7</h2>                    
                        <p>On July 21st, 1961 at 12:20 UTC astronaut Gus Grissom left launch pad LC-5 on a Redstone MRLV MR-8 rocket. This
                             mission was to be the second mission in the mercury program. This mission was a suborbital mission reaching an 
                             apogee of 190 km. This mission did not run smoothly as there were some technical faults.  </p>
                            <h4>The flight</h4>
                            <p>
                                The flight started smoothly as the spacecraft accelerated more and more as it sped through the atmosphere.
                                 During the flight, Gus Grissom noted that he did feel scared during accent, but after the rocket's systems 
                                 worked well, he felt more comfortable in the spacecraft abilities. During the high g load of the near end 
                                 of the flight, Gus Grissom notes that the intense vibrations altered his vision, although it did not interrupt 
                                 the flight. The spacecraft accelerated to 2000m/s before the engine cutoff. After cutting off the spacecraft 
                                 separated, and Gus Grisom took control before re-entry occurred. With liberty bell reaching an altitude of 190km, 
                                 3km above John glen. The re-entry went well until the main cute opened as Gus Gissum noted two small holes in the 
                                 parachute, this did not cause any issues in the flight plan except for the dumping of the capsuleâ€™s fuels, as this
                                 may be a risk. 
                            </p>
    
                              <h4>Anomalies </h4>
                              <p>
                                    After splash down Gus recorded the cockpits data, after this task was executed, he preceded to lay back in his
                                     seat, unexcitedly the hatch blew open and caused the capsule to fill up with salt water. Gus Grissom left 
                                     the capsule and was rescued by the waiting helicopter as his capsule sank to the sea floor.
