                    <h2>Friendship 7</h2>                    
                    <p>On February 20, 1962, 14:47:39 UTC a newly upgraded Atlas LV-3B 109-D lifted off from its newly built launch pad in Cape Canaveral. This flight 
                        was carrying astronaut John Glen aboard the spaceship friendship 7. This flight was to be the first orbital launch of an American into space.   </p>
                        <h4>The flight</h4>
                        <p>
                                After many delays after problems with the rockets fuel tanks and weather, on February the 20th the rocket still faced a half an hour 
                                issues with a faulty component in the guidance system, this was not the last of the issues as one bolt out of the 70 bolts that secured 
                                the capsules door had to be replaced, which took another 42 minutes. After this issue, a liquid oxygen value had to be replaced, which 
                                took a further 25 minutes. the rocket finally took off in foggy weather this proved hard to film as the rocket launched from the pad.
                                 Since this rocket was bigger than the smaller Redstone, it accelerated a bit slower, so the gâ€™s went as harsh due to the size of the 
                                 rocket, during max q john glen noted that it was very bumpy. After two minutes and fourteen seconds, the booster dropped away, and the 
                                 capsule flew into orbit. The booster had performed its job as well. The flight went well as John Glen entered orbit of earth. The
                                  spacecraft gain a roll as it did its prograde burn, but this was corrected by the RCS.  
                        </p>

                        During his first orbit, he ran into issues with the RCS thrusters, this was fixed by switching to the fly by wire, which corrected the faulty
                         thruster. During the second orbit it was noted that a sensor was sending reading that the heat shield and landing bag was not connected to the 
                         spacecraft, this would turn out to be a faulty sensor. John Glen noted that his suit temperature felt warm, for the rest of the flight he would
                          have to monitor the humidity and temperature, so he did not overheat. During his second orbit, glen was to try and spot flares, it turned out 
                          he could not see them. After this a fuel light came on, this meant John Glen had to conserve his fuel. Re-entry had issues.
