                    <p> On May 15, 1963, 13:04:13 UTC astronaut Gordon Cooper launched into orbit for what was to be the last flight of the Mercury
                         program. This flight would be the longest and most difficult mission attempted by NASA. This mission would break multiple 
                         records and prove the reliability of the mercury program, getting NASA ready for the next generation of spacecraft, the 
                         Gemini program. 
                     </p>
                        <h4>The flight</h4>
                        <p>
                            The launch into orbit went well, with no notable events occurring. After re-entry which went smoothly, he returned 
                            safely and well. 
                        </p>

                            On his second orbit, he was to conduct an experiment on his ability to spot a small ball with little lights on it
                             that were ejected from the nose cone of the ship. On the orbit the ball was jettisoned he noted that he couldn't
                              see it, but after another orbit e noted that he could see the balls lights.<img src="images/Steel ball.PNG" alt="Image_not_found" height="400" width="700"> Cooper tried to launch a small nitrogen 
                              balloon out of the spacecraft but failed to do so. Cooper's next task was to set up cameras, this was successful. 
                              Cooper then set up radiation experiments to test the levels of radiation in space. When the spacecraft flew over Asia
                               he took photos of Tibetan highlands and of the Himalayas. The rest of the flight was devoted to taking care of the
                                main systems and sleep.
