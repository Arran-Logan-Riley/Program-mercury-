                        <h2>Sigma 7</h2>                    
                        <p>On October 3, 1962, 12:15:12 UTC lifted off with astronaut Wally Schirra aboard an Atlas rocket in the spaceship Sigma 7. 
                         </p>
                            <h4>The flight</h4>
                            <p>
                                The flight went well, although there was a slight rotation at launch, it was in safe limits. During MEKO(main 
                                engine cut-off) the engine cut off two seconds early and let the sustainer engine to make up for the lost velocity
                                 and correcting the rotation. The re-entry of the spacecraft went well, except for low fuel, which caused some 
                                 issues, but nothing major. 
                            </p>
    
                              <h4>Mission objects </h4>
                              <p>
                                One objective was to test the manual control, this proved to be a lot less effective as the fly-by-wire system was 
                                a lot better. During his second orbit he powered down the spacecraft and conducted experiments on his spatial 
                                awareness. The next task was for him to conduct earth observations, which he conducted. His next task to execute
                                 was to locate the satellite echo 1, this was unsuccessful. He was supposed to locate a high-power light in Africa,
                                  this proved difficult due to could cover. During his sixth orbit, he would prepare for re-entry.
