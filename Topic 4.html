                        <h2>Aroura 7</h2>                    
                        <p>On May 24, 1962, 12:45:16 UTC astronaut Scott Carpenter launched into space aboard the spacecraft aroura 7 on an Atlas 
                            rocket. The mission flight plan was to be very similar to the earlier flight of only three months before of Friendship 7.
                         </p>
                            <h4>The flight</h4>
                            <p>
                                The vehicle performed very well during the flight, except for one anomaly where one of the sustainer engine's 
                                hydraulic switches moved to the abort position during flight. This was fixed as a sensor detected the error and 
                                correct pressure levels until after Sustainer Engine Cut-Off. The vehicle performed such a good job that it
                                 actually exceeded its orbit parameters. During orbit, he expressed concern over his ability to consume food 
                                 as he had made a mess of it in the cockpit and it was getting into ventilation. This did not cause any issues 
                                 later on. During the mission John glen flew around the earth three times in 4.5 hours. During the landing 
                                 Carpenter overshot his target by 400km this was due to human error. 
                            </p>

                              <p>
                                The main mission objective was to conduct experiments on liquids In a weightless environment. The second objective
                                 was to conduct observations of the earth from space. And to try to detect a flare from the ground, these were 
                                 successful, except for locating the flare.
